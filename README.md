# Bootstrapping Challenge

## Exploring Pitchfork reviews by genre

As part of our [Mod 2 Project](https://github.com/jnawjux/mod2_project), we were comparing the rating performance on Pitchfork of two different genres - Pop/R&B & Electronic music. In our review, we tested bootstrap sampling from our data on the two genres to check whether our results were consistent accross samples.  We focused on comparing the mean and getting the confidence intervals for the means of those two genres.  The results we found were consistent with those of our larger set of data.
